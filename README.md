## How to Use

### Step 1: Locate Your Apple Podcasts Data

Apple Podcasts stores its data in:

```
~/Library/Group Containers/243LU875E5.groups.com.apple.podcasts/
```

You'll need two things:

| File | Location |
|------|----------|
| **Database** | `Documents/MTLibrary.sqlite` |
| **Transcripts** | `Library/Cache/Assets/TTML/` |

### Step 2: Copy Transcript Files (Recommended)

To avoid any potential issues with the Podcasts app cache, copy the TTML files to a working folder first. Open Terminal and run:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Documents/podcast-transcripts && find ~/Library/Group\ Containers/243LU875E5.groups.com.apple.podcasts/Library/Cache/Assets/TTML -name "*.ttml" -exec cp -n {} ~/Documents/podcast-transcripts \;
```

This command:
- Creates a `podcast-transcripts` folder in your Documents
- Copies all TTML files from the cache (without overwriting existing files)
- Works from any directory

> **Tip:** Run this command periodically to grab transcripts for newly downloaded episodes.

### Step 3: Open the App

1. Clone this repo and open `index.html` in your browser, or
2. Use a local development server (e.g., VS Code Live Server)

### Step 4: Load Your Data

1. **Load Database** – Drag and drop `MTLibrary.sqlite` into the first drop zone
2. **Load Transcripts** – Drag TTML files from your working folder into the second drop zone

### Step 5: Search & Browse

- Use the search bar to find text across all loaded transcripts
- Toggle between 📖 Reading and ⏱️ Timestamped views
- Click any speaker label to rename it (updates throughout the transcript)
- Click 📋 to copy a transcript to your clipboard
- Click 💾 to export as a Markdown file

## Tech Stack

- **Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript** – No build tools or frameworks

- **File API** – Local file reading without uploads
- **DOMParser** – XML/TTML parsing

## Privacy

This app runs entirely in your browser. Your podcast library database and transcripts are never uploaded anywhere. All processing happens locally on your machine.

## Known Limitations

- **Orphaned Transcripts** – TTML files may exist for episodes you've deleted from your library. These will show a warning since metadata can't be found.
- **macOS Only** – Apple Podcasts cache paths are specific to macOS.
- **Safari Compatibility** – Best tested in Chrome/Firefox. Safari may have issues with some file operations.
